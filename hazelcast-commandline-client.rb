          ⚠️  To have superior experience, enable autocompletion on Brew. ⚠️
          You need to enable autocompletion just once for Brew. If it is already enabled, you can skip this part.
          ▪ For Bash users:
            1) `brew install bash-completion` and follow the printed \"Caveats\" section. Example \"Caveats\" instructions:
               Add the following line to your ~/.bash_profile:
               # !! Note that paths may differ depending on your installation, so you should follow the Caveats section on your system.
               [[ -r \"/home/ubuntu/.linuxbrew/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh\" ]] && . \"/home/ubuntu/.linuxbrew/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh\"
            2) `source ~/.bash_profile`
          ▪ For Zsh users:
          Follow https://docs.brew.sh/Shell-Completion#configuring-completions-in-zsh
